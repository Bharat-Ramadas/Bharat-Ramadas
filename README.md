## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bharat Ramadas and I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

My research interests include electric :zap: machines and drives. I also have more than three years of experience working in the field of electric vehicles :electric_plug: :car:. 
More information about my work/research experiences can be found at my [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharat-ramadas) page.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on desiging ultra-high speed (> 100,000 RPM !!) bearingless electric machines for aerial :airplane: e-turbo applications. As part of this project, I get
to work on electric machine design optimization, high performance discrete time control, and on developing the science of bearingless machines for ultra-high speed applications.

## Open Source Projects
### eMach
I'm one of the core team members working on an electric machine modeling and evaluation framework -- [eMach](https://github.com/Severson-Group/eMach). As an active contributor to
this repository, I work on interfacing different electric machine FEA tools (such as Simcenter MAGNET, JMAG etc.) with Python.
